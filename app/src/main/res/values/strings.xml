    <string name="CIS_text">
        \t The Computer Information Systems (CIS) building was constructed to house the Information Systems and Operations
        Management Department from the Cameron School of Business and the Department of Computer Science from the College of Arts and Sciences.
        The CIS Building, a new 51,731 square-foot state-of-the-art facility on the UNCW campus, opened January 10, 2007 for the new school semester.
        Work on the facility began on July 29, 2004 with the groundbreaking, and competed in December of 2006.
        The building cost approximately $12.8 million and was funded by the North Carolina State Bond campaign of 2000. \n
        \n

        \t Housed within the new building is the Financial Markets Room and, thanks to a donation from Edward Jones and over 50 if its financial advisers, the Edward Jones Financial Lab.
        Both rooms contain a stock board and ticker, however the Edward Jones Financial Lab also includes the Bloomberg Trading Terminal.
        With this terminal, students and faculty have the ability to trade stocks directly with the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and more.\n
        \n

        \t The Department of Computer Science and the Department of Information Systems and Operations Management are housed at CIS together and are jointly offering a Master of Science in Computer Science
        Information Systems (MSCSIS) degree, an intensive graduate program aimed at preparing the student to assume leadership roles in the development and implementation of computer and information systems.\n
